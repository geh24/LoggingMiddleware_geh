# LoggingMiddleware_geh

## Description

July 2018 i started to write a .NET Core middleware, that should log APi-requests.
The LoggingMiddleware project is based on NLog.

I used this project successfuly since three years, starting with .NET Core 3.1, right now the
master-branch is using .NET Core 6.0.

The name LoggingMiddleware was already used, so i appended my 3-char Initials meaning Gerhard Herre

GH3

## Demo

There is a Demo project called LoggingMiddleware_geh_Demo.
